# Pong-Game
There are some issues with this file. The game is a proper running game of the Pong game.

Issues(To be Fixed):
The ball sometimes gets stuck at the top of the screen and score goes on increasing.
In fullscreen mode the ball doesnt get rebound in the sides(has been fixed to a point but needs refinement).
